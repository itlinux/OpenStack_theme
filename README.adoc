== Create New logo
Create a new login logo and a top logo in the format of .svg
Use the following URL if you have a PNG to convert it to svg

https://www.aconvert.com/image/jpg-to-svg/

I use the link above and works very well

=== Logo
Save the login logo as

**logo-splash.png**

Save the top logo as

**logo.svg**


=== Restart httpd
[service, restart httpd]
systemctl restart httpd
